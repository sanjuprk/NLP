## Word Classification:
To illustrate classification of words we classify names into male and female i.e gender classification.
We firstly import data(names) from nltk.corpus.

#### STEPS:
* Importing data
* Extracting features from the names data
* Training using NaiveBayes 
* Classifying new data using NaiveBayes

We extract different features from the data to train,classify with more accuracy. Some are:

* The last letter off the name is a good indicator of gender. i.e any,emily etc with last letter as 'y' are usually female.
* The last letter and the last two letters
* Finally,all charecters and also their counts in the word.
