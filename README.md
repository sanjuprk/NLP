 ## Text Classification Using NLP
 
 Text classification is simplified as :
 * word classification
 * sentence classification
 * document classification

We try to classify text using most basic methods, most of these methods are not used practically but helps in giving a clear understanding of what is done during classification and lay basics for further exploration.

A dataset is taken for each of the above mentioned cases and classified mainly with the help of `nltk` in python.

### ToDo's:

Classification using advanced methods like :
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
* Word Embeddings (word2vec)
